Basic Setup
===========

- required packages:
  > g++-4.4
  > libical-dev
  > libsqlite3-dev
  > libgtk2.0-dev
  > python-pyinotify (for calsync.py)
- after the package is unzipped, run 'autoreconf -i' in the calendari directory.
- configure; make; make install
- create $HOME/.calsync/config file eg:
    """
    LOCAL:
     Home = http://<user:passwd>@icalx.com/private/<user>/Home.ics
     Work = http://<user:passwd>@icalx.com/public/<user>/Work.ics

    REMOTE:
     Other Home = http://<other_user:passwd>@icalx.com/private/<other_user>/Home.ics
    """
- run 'python calsync.py'; this will daemonise itself and refresh all calendars
- run 'calendari --import=$HOME/.calsync/<name_of_calendar>.ics
- run 'calendari' to view/edit your calendars
